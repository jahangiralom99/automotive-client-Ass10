          <p className="font-bold ml-6">
            Although steam-powered road vehicles were produced earlier, the
            origins of the automotive industry are rooted in the development of
            the gasoline engine in the 1860s and â€™70s, principally in France and
            Germany. By the beginning of the 20th century, German and French
            manufacturers had been joined by British, Italian, and American
            makers.
